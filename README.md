# Game Data Analytics and Machine Learning Models

## Overview

This project involves analyzing a dataset of game apps to gain insights into game quality, ratings, pricing, and genres. It also applies machine learning models to predict **Average User Rating** based on various features of the games. The key objectives of the project are:

1. Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the game app data to gain valuable insights.
2. Extract meaningful insights related to **developers**, **genres**, **rating trends**, **pricing**, and **user engagement**.
3. Train and evaluate various **machine learning models** to predict **Average User Rating** based on game features.

## Data Overview

The dataset used in this project contains various features related to mobile game applications. The key columns in the dataset are:


- **URL:**** The URL associated with the game.
- **ID:** The unique identifier for the game.
- **Name:** The name of the game.
- **Subtitle:** A secondary title or subtitle for the game.
- **Icon URL:** The URL for the game's icon.
- **Average User Rating:** The average rating provided by users.
- **User Rating Count:** The total number of ratings received by the game.
- **Price:** The price of the game.
- **In-app Purchases:** Information about any in-app purchases.
- **Description:** The description of the game.
- **Developer:** The developer of the game.
- **Age Rating:** The age rating for the game.
- **Languages:** The languages the game supports.
- **Size:** The size of the game in MB.
- **Primary Genre:** The primary genre of the game.
- **Genres:** The genre(s) of the game.
- **Original Release Date:** The original release date of the game.
- **Current Version Release Date:** The release date of the current version of the game.

## Data Preprocessing

### 1. Missing Value Handling

- **Numeric Columns**: Missing values in numeric columns like `Size` and `Average User Rating` were filled with the **mean** value of the respective columns.
- **Categorical Columns**: Missing values in categorical columns like `Developer` and `Genres` were replaced with the **mode** (most frequent value).
- **Dropped Irrelevant Columns**: Columns that were deemed unnecessary for analysis were dropped to improve the dataset's quality.

---

### 2. Feature Engineering

- **Language Count**: A new column **Language_Count** was created by counting the number of languages listed for each game app. The **Languages** column was subsequently dropped.
- **One-Hot Encoding**: The **Primary_Genre** column was transformed using one-hot encoding to convert categorical data into numerical values for machine learning models.

---

### 3. Data Transformation

- **Log Transformation**: The `Size` column was log-transformed to reduce skewness and handle outliers. The new log-transformed column was named `Log_Size`.
- **Outlier Handling**: Outliers in columns like `Price` were detected using the **Interquartile Range (IQR)** method and were capped or removed based on certain thresholds.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 1. Descriptive Statistics

The initial step in EDA involved calculating basic descriptive statistics of the numerical features, including:

- Mean, Median, and Mode
- Standard Deviation and Variance
- Range (Min-Max)
- Distribution shape

### 2. Data Visualizations

Several visualizations were created to understand the distribution and trends in the data:

- **Rating Counts by Genre**: A bar chart showing the total rating counts for each genre.
- **Price Distribution**: A histogram to visualize the distribution of game prices.
- **Average User Rating Trend**: A line plot showing the trend of average user ratings from 2010 to 2015.
- **Top 5 Games by User Rating Count**: A bar chart representing the games with the highest rating counts.

These visualizations provided valuable insights into the relationships between various features in the dataset.

## Machine Learning Model Development

### 1. Model Selection

Several machine learning models were used to predict the **Average User Rating** based on other game features. These models include:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Decision Tree Regressor**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM) Regressor**
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regressor**

### 2. Model Training and Evaluation

The dataset was split into training and testing sets using a **70-30 split**. The models were then trained using the training data, and their performance was evaluated based on the **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** metric.

**Model Performance:**
- **Linear Regression**: RMSE = 0.512
- **Decision Tree Regressor**: RMSE = 0.645
- **Random Forest Regressor**: RMSE = 0.480
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM) Regressor**: RMSE = 0.520
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regressor**: RMSE = 0.552

From the results, **Random Forest Regressor** performed the best with the lowest RMSE, suggesting it is the most effective model for predicting the **Average User Rating**.

## Key Insights and Recommendations

1. **Top Developers by App Count**: 
   - Tapps Technology and Vikash Patel are the top two developers with 121 and 94 apps, respectively.

2. **Genres with the Highest Rating Counts**: 
   - Strategy games have the highest rating counts (11M), followed by Action (5M) and Entertainment (4M) genres.

3. **Average User Rating Trend**: 
   - The average user rating has steadily increased from around 0.2 in 2010 to around 10.9 in 2015, indicating an overall improvement in game quality over time.

4. **Top 5 Games by Rating Count**:
   - Games like **Clash of Clans**, **Clash Royale**, **Plants vs Zombies 2**, **Pok√©mon GO**, and **PUBG MOBILE** have the highest rating counts.

5. **Age Rating**: 
   - The minimum age rating in the dataset is 4, while the maximum is 17, suggesting a wide range of game content suitable for different age groups.

6. **Most Expensive Games**:
   - Premium titles such as **African Cheetah Wild Animal Simulator 3D Full** and **Army Truck Offroad Simulator 3D Full Drive mini truck** are among the most expensive games in the dataset.
